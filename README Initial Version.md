# Executive Summary

### Overview of Findings

[Sales Trends Visualisation here]

Between 2019 and 2022, WebOne Gadgets made $28M in Revenue across an Order Count of 108k, earning an AOV of $260 per order.
- Revenue grew steadily on launch and reached a record $10.1M in 2020, driven by pandemic spending on laptops & gaming monitor from its non-loyalty customers. Following this peak, laptop prices gradually dropped and customers started to order less, leading to a sharp fall in AOV, Order Count, and Revenue which culminated in an unusually poor holiday season in 2022.
- Loyalty program members brought in $10.9M (31%) of Revenue across all 4 years. However, since 2021, these contribute 54% of Revenue. Furthermore, 42% of non-members' $17.1M Revenue comes from 2020 alone, suggesting one-off, pandemic-driven purchases. Additionally, member AOV remained consistent around $250 from 2021 till Q3-2022 while non-member AOV dipped to $213 in Q3-2022 from its spike of $375 in Q4-2020.
- Customers sought refunds at higher rates for pricier products. The overall refund rate was estimated around 7.8%. Among laptops, this was 16%, and for the gaming monitor, 9.5%. Loyalty program members sought refunds for almost twice as many products (11.4%) as non-members (5.8%), particularly affecting Apple Airpods and the gaming monitor.

# Assumptions and Caveats:

Throughout the analysis, multiple assumptions were made to manage challenges with the data. These assumptions and caveats are noted below:

* Assumption 1 (ex: missing country records were for customers based in the US, and were re-coded to be US citizens)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: data for December 2021 was missing - this was imputed using a combination of historical trends and December 2020 data)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: because 3% of the refund date column contained non-sensical dates, these were excluded from the analysis)
